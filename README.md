## Installation
The beta release is the folder titled "Retask Distribution" folder. I have only been able to test on two Windows 10 machines. Download the entire folder and launch the app using retask.exe. I recommend putting the dist folder out of sight and creating a shortcut for the executable.

## Instructions

Add tasks using the plus button in the top left or ctrl+n.

Change the font size or layout with the settings button.

Search task text, or use :f and/or :g to search by frequency or group. :g Progra :f One orange will display any tasks in the Programming group with a frequency of One-time and a text containing orange.

Toggle the display of scheduled tasks using the "Dispaly Scheduled Tasks" Button. This allows you to mark a completed task as incomplete. 

Add or delete groups using the "Manage Groups" button.


### Completing a Task
Tasks disappear when they are marked as complete, using the checkbox in the task box. Tasks with a frequency other than one-time are put in a list with a refresh date. This list is checked when the program opens and tasks are displayed again when their refresh dates are passed. Tasks on this list can be displayed and marked incomplete using the "Display Scheduled Tasks" toggle button.

If the task is a one-time task, it can only be recoverd in the current session using ctrl+z. After that it's gone, permanently.

Clicking on a task enters edit mode, where you can change the task text, frequency, group, and delete the task.
