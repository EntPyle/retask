# Retask
A to do list program built for recurring tasks. 

The beta release is in the Retask Distribution folder. I have only been able to test on two Windows 10 machines. Download the entire folder and launch the app using retask.exe. I recommend putting the dist folder out of sight and creating a shortcut for the executable.
